Slides of my ECMA Script 6 quiz at DevRocket (March 2015).

Built with [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/) (actually, this repo is a fork).

The theme I used is the `night` one. Then customised it quickly to can display chunks of code in a bigger resolution and added few classes to have style for questions and answers. I also changed the font to use [Raleway](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Raleway).
